# Odin_Recipe

## Project Overview

This project is part of **The Odin Project – Foundations Course**.
In this project, I built a **basic recipe website** to practice core **HTML fundamentals**.

The goal was not visual design, but to strengthen my understanding of:

- HTML structure
- Semantic elements
- File organization
- Relative links between pages
- Writing clean, readable markup

Styling and layout are intentionally minimal and will be revisited later with CSS.

## What I Built

I created a small multi-page website consisting of:

- A main **index page** that acts as a homepage
- Individual **recipe pages**, each with consistent structure
- Navigation links between the homepage and recipe pages

Each recipe page includes:

- A heading with the recipe name
- An image of the finished dish
- A short description
- An unordered list of ingredients
- An ordered list of preparation steps

## Skills Practiced

Through this project, I practiced and reinforced:

- HTML boilerplate structure
- Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Image embedding
- Relative file paths (`../`)
- Organizing files and folders in a project
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Writing meaningful commit messages
